## Is this really useful?
This is mainly up to you, but it can be very useful.

## Are there any requirements?
Yes, you need a computer, a wiiu, an sd card that contains [tcpgecko](https://www.wiiubru.com/appstore/#/app/TCPgecko) and [homebrew launcher](https://www.wiiubru.com/appstore/#/app/homebrew_launcher).
You also need [python 3](https://www.python.org/).<br />
<br />
On your computer, please check that you have these three files (from version 1.4 onwards this is no longer necessary unless you choose the source code version)<br />
`DARKU.py` and `common.py` and `tcpgecko.py`<br />
<br />
If you have chosen version 1.4.3 or higher, please run this command in a terminal.(only for the uncompiled version)<br />
Windows : `pip install pypresence`<br />
Linux        : `pip3 install pypresence`<br />

## Installation

From version 1.4 or higher, simply double-click on the file of your operating system.<br />
<br />
If you have taken a version lower than 1.4 (example versions 1.2) All you have to do in a terminal is to execute the following command.<br />
