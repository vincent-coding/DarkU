## Library used

#### WARNING: The libraries are already installed with the software, except for the decompiled version.

- **Tkinter**<br />
Tkinter allows to create all the interface of the software.<br />
It is often installed with python, but just in case here is the command to install it.<br />
Windows: `py -3 -m pip install tkinter` or `pip install tkinter`<br />
Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`<br />

- **PyPresence**<br />
PyPresence is a library to display a status on Discord.<br />
Windows: `pip install pypresence`<br />
Linux: `pip3 install pypresence`<br />

- **PyGecko**<br />
This library is already installed in the software, even in the decompiled version!

## Installing the software
- **Decompiled version**<br />
The decompiled version works with all operating systems with python3.<br />
Unfortunately, this version requires the installation of all modules. (More information in the **Library** section).<br />

- **Compiled version**<br />
There are two compiled versions. The one for windows and the one for linux.<br />
Their operation is very close, just download the version for its operating system and double click on the software icon. The software should launch and you can then choose the version for your WiiU.<br />
